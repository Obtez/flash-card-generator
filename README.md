<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

When creating flash cards for print, it can be a hassle to work with typical text processors such as
Microsoft Word or Pages. The goal was making the creation process of flash cards as easy and quick
as possible without having to arrange and click into text-fields.

The cards are saved in the browser's local storage.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The application shines when it comes to speed. Use TAB to switch between inputs and hit enter to
save the card. The first input will be focused again, so you don't have to touch your mouse at any
time.

Because of the proportions of flash cards, the maximum amount of characters per input is set to 140.
